# Quantar v.24 Sync to/from Async Hardware.

This is the sourcecode for the Microchip PICs 15F887 or 16F884 for the v.24 board created by Juan Carlos Perez KM4NNO.
This board converts Sync to Async HDLC and Async to Sync HDLC.
Quantar/DIU3000 needs to be the master clock (set them to internal clock).

Buffer from Sync to Async is unlimited.
Buffer from Async to Sync is limited to 120/112 bytes, but need testing.
